# IMPORTANT NOTICES


## 1. Wearing a mask is **REQUESTED** in this class

-   To reduce the risk of infection and increase the possibility of
    wellness allowing us to focus on learning and working together, it
    is requested that you consider wearing a face mask
    fully covering both mouth and nose *before* you enter the classroom
    and keep it in place *at all times*.

-   Make sure you have a "properly-fitting, high-quality mask (preferably
    a surgical mask, KN95/KF94, N95, or
    [EHRS-recommended
    Aries mask](https://ehrs.upenn.edu/covid-19/mask-guidance-march-15-2022) as opposed to a single layer cloth mask)." (UPenn Public
    Health Guidance).

-   This is a request for us to think socially about how our choices
    impact others and how we can maximize learning opportunities. There
    is some data and a infographic you can critique as budding data
    scientists at <https://bit.ly/MMWR7106>. **Please respect each other's
    choices on this issue**.

-   The information and advice on [this page](https://www.georgetown.edu/coronavirus/) (from a different
    educational institution) is helpful.


## 2. ZOOM AND CLASS RECORDINGS

-   **ZOOM AND CLASS ATTENDANCE WHEN UNWELL** - If you feel sick or are
    showing symptoms of Covid-19, flu or cold then **PLEASE BE
    CONSIDERATE** of your classmates and attend the class remotely
    through Zoom. All class sessions will be available live through Zoom (see links in Canvas) and as recordings.

# Course Description Goals and Objective

Acquiring and demonstrating data literacy, namely, the ability to find,
appropriately handle, analyze and communicate insights from the rapidly
growing spectrum of data in all aspects of modern life, is now a vital
skill for virtually all workers and researchers. This course provides a
foundation in the concepts, methods and applications of data science
(including network science) to questions in Communication.

The course will:

-   Build data literacy and help you start to develop skills working with
    large and complex datasets of relevance to communication behaviors in
    the digital world.

-   Help you become familiar with basic programming skills for data
    analysis using the R and Python programming languages, along with some
    of the common tools used for network and data analysis and
    visualization.

-   Provide an introduction and overview of the key elements of applied
    data science, including the analysis of networks and machine learning
    (ML).

-   Consider the practical and ethical challenges of 'big data',
    unbiquitous data tracking and the increasing use of algorithmic (ML)
    decision systems.

The course serves as an introduction to and overview of courses within
the Data and Network Science concentration for the Communication major.
No prior programming or data analysis experience is required.


# Assessment

-   Quizes (15%)
    -   Most weeks there will be a short quiz related to the lecture and
        readings for the week. The quiz will be available in Canvas.

-   Short paper [1000-1500 words] and annotated bibliography (15%)
    -   A reflection/discussion paper focused on **a data related** issue. The
        paper should be written in Markdown.
    -   An annotated bibliography supporting your topic with 8-12 sources
        should be completed first. At least 3 of these sources should be
        relevant and recent academic papers.

-   Lab Assignments (25%)
    -   Building on the material covered in the weekly lab sessions, which
        focus on gaining some practical skills working with in Python and R,
        these assignments will contain questions designed to help you
        practice. The assignments will be available and submitted within
        JupyterHub.

-   Quantified Self Assignment (15%)
    -   Throughout the semester you will complete a quick daily rating task
        to build up a personal data set of your mood and relevant events.
    -   You can choose to add in other data (e.g. location, movement or
        social media logs, etc).
    -   You will analyze the data to observe patterns and trends and
        interpret any associations (e.g. with days of the week, a particular
        event, etc.)
    -   You will then write a short blog post describing your findings.

-   Data project (30%)
    -   The project should make use of the techniques and theory covered in
        class to carry out a data analysis of a specific research question
        agreed upon with the instructor.
    -   The aim of the project is to work through the steps in a typical
        data science project. The steps include:
        -   Develop a focused research question and some testable hypotheses
        -   Acquire, clean and organize relevant data
        -   Carry exploratory data analysis (and visualization)
        -   Develop data analysis to answer research questions and hypotheses
        -   Interpret patterns
        -   Communicate findings in an engaging data story
    
    -   More details of the kinds of projects that would be appropriate and
        manageable will be discussed as the class progresses.


# Textbooks and recommended readings


## Textbooks

-   The two books by Ben Jones in *The Data Literacy Series*:
    1.  *Data Literacy Fundamentals: Understanding the Power & Value of
        Data* (Abbreviated as `DLF` on schedule)
    2.  *Learning to See Data: How to Interpret the Visual Language of
        Charts* (Abbreviates as `LSD` on schedule)

-   Some chapters from following books (Abbreviated as `DSIC` and `DF` on schedule):
    1.  Spector, A.Z., Norvig, P., Wiggins, C. and Wing,
        J.M. (2023). *Data Science in Context: Foundations, Challenges,
        Opportunities*. Cambrdige: Cambridge University Press.  (Book is
        available online through the library)

## References for Python and R coding

1.  McGregor, S.E. (2021) *Practical Python Data Wrangling and Data
    Quality*. O'Reilly Media. (This text is available through the Penn
    library: <https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/practical-python-data/9781492091493/>)
    -   We will use certain sections of this book in the lab sessions for
        learning how to work with data using Python. The whole book is a
        useful reference and introduction.

        use R. The book focuses on using `ggplot` for visualization and the
        `tidyverse` libraries for data analysis, just as we will.
    -   There is more advanced material in the book that we won't be able
        to cover but it is well worth spending some time trying some of the
        exercises throughout the chapters.

# Note about learning programming

-   One of the aims of this class is to help students begin to develop
    data analysis and programming skills that they can use as a part of
    carrying out research. But like learning any new skill, such as a
    new spoken language, it takes time and can be frustrating at
    first. This course does not require students to have any programming
    background. Realistically it is not possible to become a fully
    proficient programmer in just one semester. However, the lab
    sessions and assignments are focused on helping you begin this
    process and to become comfortable with reading, understanding and
    modifying Python and R code examples that you can find on the web
    etc.

-   **Using generative AI tools** - We will talk more about the potential
    benefits and drawbacks of using generative AI tools such as ChatGPT
    and Copilot to learn programming as the course progresses. There is
    neither a blanket prohibition or full encouragement for the use of
    these developing tools in this course. I will provide more guidance
    as we go along.

# Schedule


## **NOTE** This is a tentative schedule is will be updated as the course progresses


## Class structure

-   Usually each class session will be divided into two parts:

-   **Content and Discussion** - This part of the class will introduce
    and review the key topics onlined in the schedule. It is important
    that you read the assigned material BEFORE the class as you'll be
    expected to engage in discussion and other activities based on this
    content.
-   **Lab activities** - The second part will be focused on pratical
    exercises to put into practice what we have been learning about
    thinking about, collecting, analyzing, interpreting and
    communicating data. This will include learning some basic steps
    using Python and R scripts and some other tools for data analysis
    and visualization.
